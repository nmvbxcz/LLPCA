# LLPCA
- Local Label Propagation (LLP).
- Local Label Propagation with Class Attention (LLPCA).

## Parameter:
The data sets and  number of training samples can be selected within the code.  
- DataSetName in {'Indianpines', 'PaviaU', 'HongHu'}
- number indicates the number of training samples selected for each category.
- d indicates the radius.
- k indicates the minimum threshold for the number of allowed propagations in CA mask.(only for LLPCA)

## Usage:
For example, when DataSet Indianpines takes 5-30 training sample points for each class, the method of calling LLP and LLPCA algorithm for "Indianpines" is as follows:
- LLP("Indianpines",[5,10,15,20,25,30],2);
- LLPCA("Indianpines",[5,10,15,20,25,30],1,10);

## Algorithm:

Local Label Propagation: The following figure illustrates the label propagation in different scenarios of LLP, corresponding to: (1) no labeled samples in the local area, (2) labeled samples present in the local area, and (3) no labeled samples in the local area, but labeled samples present within the local areas of neighboring samples.
